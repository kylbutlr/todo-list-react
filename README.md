# Todo List (React)

#### React front-end for a basic todo list application

Create, edit, and delete todo entries with optional time and date requirements. Sorts entries into 3 groups, entries with a date set to the current day (Today's Todos), incomplete entries, and complete (marked complete/done) entries. These groups can be individually hidden. Also features responsive web design for cross-device compatibility.

Created to be used with [Todo List API](https://github.com/kylbutlr/todo-list-api)

Uses: React, Axios, Sass, Bulma, RWD

2. Start the server: ```npm start``` 
3. App can be found at: ```localhost:3000```
